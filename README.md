Tower-of-defense2D
==================

Is a 2D game writen in a C++ project but actually most of the code is C.

Instead of classes we have structs holding the properties of each object.

The physics involve in the game are our own implementation, is a basic lite game engine
containing all the physic laws needed in the game.

We use the allegro 4.2.2 graphic library that allows us to manage all the multimedia
resources used in the game, that is images, sprites, music, etc.
